Our ecosystem, hosting tens of thousands of web3 players, will introduce the NFT Marketplace with its 2.0 version. Users can buy, sell, lend, or borrow NFTs in this marketplace. Users engaging with borrowed NFTs in games will not only earn income based on the in-game mechanics but also create a way of earning passive income for the NFT owners who lent their NFTs to receive rental fees.

NFTs can also reside in the exclusive Faction Vaults. Users can transact their NFTs within their Factions, such as buying, selling, borrowing, or lending, or conduct these transactions openly on the NFT Marketplace for everyone.
