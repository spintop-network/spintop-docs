Gamepedia is a community-driven gaming guide that prioritizes UI/UX along with the social aspects of blockchain gaming. It is a gamified hub that aims to bring the scattered blockchain gaming ecosystems and communities together. Listings will be covering projects from all of the major smart chains. Gamepedia will work together with the rest of our products to contribute to an environment where users can discover, play, invest and earn in the blockchain gaming ecosystem.
