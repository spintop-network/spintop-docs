"Connecting web3 games and gamers."

Gamepedia serves as our primary bridge in establishing the connection mentioned above. It houses overviews of nearly 450 web3 games, featuring guides with game-related tips and detailed explanations. It stands out as the most user-friendly infrastructure and design in the web3 gaming ecosystem, allowing everyone to share their comments and opinions on their favorite games.

Perhaps the first and only web3 game library curated by hardcore gamers for web3 gamers, Gamepedia has been visited by half a million web3 gamers from 2021 to the present. With its operational structure and well-thought-out design, Gamepedia not only connects games and gamers but also enables gamers to take direct action and start playing their preferred games immediately.

**Upcoming Features:**

In addition to serving as a primary bridge, the upcoming 2.0 version will bring numerous new features and colors to Gamepedia. These upcoming features will elevate Gamepedia beyond its role as a "web3 game library," transforming it into a more interactive, enjoyable, social, highly visited, and rewarding web3 gaming platform for everyone.

1. **Quest System:**

The quest system turns Gamepedia into a platform with gamification elements in its own right. This system, centered around rewarding users for completing various fun quests, not only provides users with new excitement and goals but also opens the door to reaching and engaging a massive potential gamer base for web3 games.

2. **Faction System:**

The Faction system allows gamers or games to create communities united for a specific purpose using $SPIN within the Spintop ecosystem. Factions, equipped with their personal NFT Vaults and different governance structures, enable gamers and games to collaborate for a common goal or goals, facilitating collective ownership, action, and enjoyment.

3. **Lootboxes:**

Lootboxes are boxes that can be purchased with $SPIN. They offer a chance to win a random reward from specific pools of prizes and NFTs. They are designed for those seeking extra excitement.

4. **Raffles:**

Raffles are events in which anyone who purchases a ticket with $SPIN can participate. They feature a pool of prizes of various values in which luck plays an important role. They are particularly ideal for those who are confident in their luck.

5. **Social Aspects:**

With the 2.0 version, we are elevating the social platform experience by integrating in-site chat functionality and personalized user profiles that other users can check out and track actions.\
