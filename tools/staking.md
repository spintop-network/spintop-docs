# üè¶ Staking

[https://staking.spintop.network/](https://staking.spintop.network/)

Staking is the platform within our ecosystem that offers the potential for financial gains thanks to its high Annual Percentage Rates (APRs). It hosts pools and farms for projects we are partnered with or have launched on our Launchpad. The presence of pools and farms in Staking, particularly for games launched, provides additional utility to token holders of those projects post-Token Generation Event (TGE) and minimizes selling pressure for the projects.
